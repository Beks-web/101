    <h2>Electric and Gasoline Engines</h2>
    <p>
      Research and compare the efficiency, environmental impact, and cost of
      electric vs. gasoline engines. Present your findings with graphs, charts,
      and a simple model or simulation.
    </p>

    <h2>Renewable Energy in Cars</h2>
    <p>
      Investigate how solar panels or other renewable energy sources can be
      integrated into car design. You could create a prototype or a detailed
      plan for incorporating these technologies.
    </p>

    <h2>Car Safety Technology</h2>
    <p>
      Study modern safety technologies like automatic braking, lane-keeping
      assist, or collision avoidance systems. Create a presentation or a working
      model demonstrating how these technologies work.
